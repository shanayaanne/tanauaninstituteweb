<h2>This class is a Foundation Course required for several degree
plans. It provides students with a set of universal skills and
knowledge in the fundamentals of drawing, which can be
applied to any specialization in the visual communication
industry.<br>
In addition it specifically lays the groundwork for the
Graphic Design, Animation and Computer Illustration classes.
Illustration plays a key role in all formats where visual
meaning and storytelling use images to render a narrative.
Illustrators are trained professionals who can draw in a variety
of media not limited to pen and pencil, but also, especially in
todayâ€™s hyper-digital world, digital image-making.
<br>
Being able
to utilize the best of technology to render images is becoming
essential for any aspiring illustrator..
